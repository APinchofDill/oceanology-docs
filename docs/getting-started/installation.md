<!-- ## Process #3: Create a Test Project

1. After the installation of the add-on is complete, create a test project.
2. It is recommended to generate a simple project for initial testing. We will name our test project **BaseProject**.

**Note:** Before integrating the add-on into your main project, generating a test project is recommended.

## Process #4: Add Important Code

1. Once the project is generated, navigate to the **Config** folder of your project.

# Setup Guide

Provides a step-by-step guide to setup Oceanology requirments. If you need help adding Oceanology to your scene after all requirements have been configured video here [TODO VIDEO] 

!!! note

    Before integrating Oceanology into your main project, generating a test project is recommended.

Before jumping into it lets create a new Unreal third person sample project. You may name it what you wish.

### DefaultEngine.ini

These settings are important to make sure that your render settings play nice with oceanology. Feel free to merge your custom settings with the requirments below but keep in mind we can't test all settings so if you experience issues feel free to head over to our discord community.

!!! note

    Important code may vary depending on the version of the engine. This code is used to correct rendering problems, such as strange artifacts and blinking when moving a plane.

``` ini
[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]
r.GenerateMeshDistanceFields=True
r.DynamicGlobalIlluminationMethod=1
r.ReflectionMethod=1
r.Shadow.Virtual.Enable=1
r.DefaultFeature.AutoExposure.ExtendDefaultLuminanceRange=True
r.DefaultFeature.LocalExposure.HighlightContrastScale=0.8
r.DefaultFeature.LocalExposure.ShadowContrastScale=0.8
```

Next open your project you created above from the launcher and navigate to the plugins settings

</figure>

## Process #3: Create a Test Project

1. After the installation of the add-on is complete, create a test project.
2. It is recommended to generate a simple project for initial testing. We will name our test project **BaseProject**.

![Create Test Project](image3_path)

**Note:** Before integrating the add-on into your main project, generating a test project is recommended.

## Process #4: Add Important Code

1. Once the project is generated, navigate to the **Config** folder of your project.

![Config Folder](image4_path)

2. Open the file **DefaultEngine.ini**.

![Open DefaultEngine.ini](image5_path)

3. Replace the default code generated by the engine with the code provided in the Discord community.

![Replace Code](image6_path)

**Important Note:** The important code may vary depending on the version of the engine. This code is used to correct rendering problems, such as strange artifacts and blinking when moving a plane.

## Process #5: Open Project and Restart

1. Open your project **BaseProject**.

![Open Project](image7_path)

2. Select the **Plugins** option.

![Select Plugins](image8_path)

3. Look for the Oceanology add-on purchased in the Marketplace.

4. Restart the project **BaseProject**.

![Restart Project](image9_path)

## Process #6: Search for the Add-On and Finalize Installation

1. Once the project is restarted, enable the visibility of the files, as these may be hidden by default.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** option and enable visibility for:

   - Content of the engine
   - Content of the plugin

![Enable Visibility](image10_path)

3. In the search section, type **Oceanology** to confirm the installation.

![Search for Add-On](image11_path)

Congratulations! The installation process has been completed. Enjoy using your new add-on!
